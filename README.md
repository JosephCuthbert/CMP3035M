# CMP3035M_Cross_Platfrom_Design
 
 
Commenting to come. 

This was an optional module that I did during my Third Year at the University of Lincoln. The goal of the module was to understand mobile app design and develop a mobile app for either Android or iOS. I chose iOS as I had prior experience in developing for the platform, the app was initially going to be an app that allowed for users to view and purchase literature based around mental health, with an integrated eBook reader. The scope was a bit large the use of API’s that are not available inevitable made the app not viable. The current development was developed around the idea of when the general public of the UK were under lockdown restrictions due to COVID-19. By allowing users of the app to ask or give products and items to those in their local area that needed certain items, with an integrated area for delivery services from most of the UK’s largest supermarkets. The app can also work for when a lockdown is not in place, by having those who are elderly or have restricted movement to ask for help in their local areas. 
The idea and development ultimately gained a grade of 2:1 or 60.0%.
